# Reckon

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cantino/reckon.png)](https://travis-ci.org/cantino/reckon)

Reckon automagically converts CSV files for use with the command-line accounting tool [Ledger](https://github.com/jwiegley/ledger/wiki).  It also helps you to select the correct accounts associated with the CSV data using Bayesian machine learning.

## Installation

Assuming you have Ruby and [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org/pages/download) installed on your system, simply run

    (sudo) gem install reckon

## Example Usage

First, login to your bank and export your transaction data as a CSV file.

To see how the CSV parses:
  
    reckon -f bank.csv -p

If your CSV file has a header on the first line, include `--contains-header`.

To convert to ledger format and label everything, do:
  
    reckon -f bank.csv -o output.dat

To have reckon learn from an existing ledger file, provide it with -l:
  
    reckon -f bank.csv -l 2010.dat -o output.dat

Learn more:

    > reckon -h
    
    Usage: Reckon.rb [options]

    -f, --file FILE                  The CSV file to parse
    -a, --account name               The Ledger Account this file is for
    -v, --[no-]verbose               Run verbosely
    -i, --inverse                    Use the negative of each amount
    -p, --print-table                Print out the parsed CSV in table form
    -o, --output-file FILE           The ledger file to append to
    -l, --learn-from FILE            An existing ledger file to learn accounts from
        --ignore-columns 1,2,5
                                     Columns to ignore in the CSV file - the first column is column 1
        --contains-header
                                     The first row of the CSV is a header and should be skipped
        --csv-separator ','
                                     Separator for parsing the CSV - default is comma.
        --comma-separates-cents
                                     Use comma instead of period to deliminate dollars from cents when parsing ($100,50 instead of $100.50)
        --encoding
                                     Specify an encoding for the CSV file
    -c, --currency '$'               Currency symbol to use, defaults to $ (Â£, EUR)
        --date-format '%d/%m/%Y'     Force the date format (see Ruby DateTime strftime). Default is %m/%d/%Y. Special values include chase, nordea, germany, and guess.
        --suffixed
                                     If --currency should be used as a suffix. Defaults to false.
    -h, --help                       Show this message
        --version                    Show version

If you find CSV files that it can't parse, send me examples or pull requests!

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
